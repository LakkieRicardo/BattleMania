# BattleMania Plugins

This is where you can find all of the BattleMania plugins. Each server will have the following plugins installed:

- TestServer
  - `BattleCore`
  - `BattleTest`
- ProxyServer
  - `BattleProxy`

This project uses Maven as its build tool, and Velocity and PaperMC as its APIs. This is developed to work only on a Velocity proxy and PaperMC server, and there may be dependency on the server worlds as well for game servers.
